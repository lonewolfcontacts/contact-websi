# Lone Wolf Contacts (Starter)

Lone Wolf Contacts is a static GitHub Pages starter for a digital business contact directory.
This build focuses on per-user profile pages (unique links + QR codes) and a black & white theme.

## How to add a profile manually (quick)
- Copy `profiles/sample-profile.html` -> `profiles/your-name.html`
- Copy `profiles/sample-profile.json` -> `profiles/your-name.json`
- Edit the JSON with your details, and upload both files to your repo root (keep the `profiles/` folder)
- Visit `https://<your-username>.github.io/<repo-name>/profiles/your-name.html` to view the profile.

## Future improvements
- Connect a serverless backend to allow users to sign up and auto-create profiles.
- Add validation and moderation tools.
- Add category listing and search (can be done client-side with a JSON index).
